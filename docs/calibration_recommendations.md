# Calibration Recommendations

Based on the validation analysis, here are recommended adjustments to improve
the Assessment Analyzer's accuracy and reliability.

---

## 1. Fairness Score Thresholds

Current thresholds:
- Fair: 21-40
- Monitor: 41-60
- Appeal: 61-80
- Strong Appeal: 81-100


### Recommendation: KEEP current thresholds

**Rationale:** Median score is within expected range (30-40). Current thresholds
are appropriate.

✓ No changes needed

---

## 2. Confidence Calculation

Current confidence calculation uses:
- Sample size (50% weight): Asymptotic to 50 points at 20 comparables
- Consistency (50% weight): Based on coefficient of variation


### Recommendation: MAINTAIN current criteria

**Rationale:** Average comparable count is within expected range (10-20).

✓ No changes needed

---

## 3. Savings Estimation Parameters

Current parameters:
- Default mill rate: 65.0
- Minimum worthwhile savings: $100/year


---

## 4. Comparable Matching Criteria

Current criteria (from ComparableService):
- Geographic proximity
- Similar total value
- Same property type
- Recent sales/assessments


### Recommendation: Consider RELAXING value requirements for edge cases

**Rationale:** High similarity is good, but may leave some properties without comparables.

**Proposed changes:**
- Implement tiered matching (strict first, then relaxed if needed)
- Use wider criteria for unique properties

---

## 5. Data Quality Filters

Current validation analysis identified:
- 0 properties with unusual assessment ratios
- 0 properties with zero comparables

### Recommendations:

1. **Pre-analysis filtering:**
   - Exclude properties with ratios <10% or >30% from automated analysis
   - Flag for manual review

2. **Property type classification:**
   - Enhance property type detection to avoid comparing residential to commercial
   - Add special handling for agricultural/exempt properties

3. **Geographic boundaries:**
   - Ensure comparable search respects jurisdiction boundaries
   - Consider subdivision/neighborhood as matching criteria

---

## 6. Implementation Priority

### High Priority (Immediate)
1. Verify and correct mill rate if needed
2. Implement data quality filters for extreme ratios

### Medium Priority (Next iteration)
1. Adjust fairness score thresholds based on median analysis
2. Refine comparable matching criteria

### Low Priority (Future enhancement)
1. Property-specific mill rates by tax district
2. Tiered comparable matching for edge cases
3. Machine learning model for comparable weighting

---

## 7. Monitoring Metrics

After implementing calibrations, monitor these metrics:

- **Fairness Score Distribution:** Should remain centered around 30-40
- **Appeal Rate:** Should stabilize around 10-15%
- **Comparable Count:** Average should be 12-18
- **Edge Case Rate:** Should decrease below 5%

Run this validation script monthly to track improvements.
